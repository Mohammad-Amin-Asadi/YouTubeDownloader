**Here we have a good quality application that it can make us able to download any video from Youtube**

### it would be great if you add these things to my project :
- [ ] creat a downloading bar that shows the downloading process to the user from 0% to 100% 
- [ ] delete the raw video and audio files if the user wants to ,and just hold the merjed file NOTE: delte the audio and video after these two files merged.
- [ ] instead of youtube itags that shows user some infos with a number of itag about the quality and the format creat a beautiful table that it can shows these things in a better way.
- [ ] make a setup for this project

HAVE FUN :)
